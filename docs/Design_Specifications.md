# Design Specifications
> This document outlines the design specifications for the _NAY NAY IS KOOT_, a single-page website that will host various quizzes, minigames, etc. for a 12-year-old audience. It covers the visual design, layout, and user interface elements of the website.

## **1. Project Overview**
*NAY NAY IS KOOT* is a web-based platform designed to provide engaging interactive activities for my 12 year-old sister. The platform will feature a single-page application with a Spotify widget for background music and a variety of microservice-based activities, including quizzes and minigames.

### 1.1 Stakeholders
The primary stakeholder for this project is my 12 year-old sister. 

Secondary stakeholders include our family, and my sister's friends.

Interests include: *games*, *animation*, *music*, *absurdist comedy*. 

### 1.2 Design Goals
